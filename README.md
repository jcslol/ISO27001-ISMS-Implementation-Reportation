# ISO27001-ISMS-Implementation-Reportation
This repository contains my individual contributions to a university project on implementing an Information Security Management System (ISMS) based on ISO 27001:2017. It includes risk assessment, GAP analysis, information security policies, and an actionable improvement plan, showcasing my understanding of ISO standards and security frameworks.

# ISO 27001:2017 ISMS Implementation Report  
## **Project Overview**  
This project focuses on designing, implementing, and reviewing an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)** for **SMS AB** in compliance with the **ISO 27001:2017 standard**. The work includes:  
- Designing organizational structures and steering documents.  
- Conducting **risk assessments**, **GAP analysis**, and developing an **action plan**.  
- Addressing security challenges, such as **ransomware** and **insider threats**.  

## **Objectives**  
- Develop an **actionable ISMS plan** to meet ISO 27001:2017 requirements.  
- Identify and mitigate **security risks**.  
- Establish **information security policies** and management reviews.  
- Promote security awareness and address **long-term goals**.  

## **My Contributions**  
This repository showcases **my individual contributions** to the project:  

### **Report Contributions**  
- **Section 2.1**: Organizational Roles and Responsibilities  
    - Defined and structured roles, including **CISO**, **DPO**, and IT security specialists.  
- **Section 2.2**: Information Security Objectives  
    - Created the **objective graph** and documented prioritized security goals.  
- **Section 2.3**: Information Security Policy  
    - Contributed to the drafting of key security policies aligned with **Annex A controls**.  
- **References**:  
    - Formatted the entire reference section using **Harvard referencing**.  

### **Reflections**  
Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in:  
- Implementing ISO 27001 standards for a real-world organization.

- Understanding organizational security roles and responsibilities.  

## **Highlights**  
The ISMS design for SMS AB includes:  
1. **Organizational Structure**: Recommended roles like **CISO**, **DPO**, and **IT Security Officers**.  
2. **Information Security Policy**: Proposed policies focusing on **encryption, access control, physical security**, and more.  
3. **Action Plan**: Developed a prioritized plan addressing **high-risk areas**, including server stability, encryption, and compliance.  
4. **Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Addressed risks like natural disasters, insider threats, and changing customer requirements.  

## **Key Learning Outcomes**  
- Practical implementation of **ISO 27001:2017**.  
- Developing **security policies** and **controls** mapped to **Annex A**.  
- Performing **GAP analysis** and prioritizing security objectives.  
- Enhancing security awareness through structured **training programs**.  

## **Technologies and Standards Used**
